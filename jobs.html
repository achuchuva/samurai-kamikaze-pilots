            <p><strong><em>Job Summary:</em></strong></p>
            <p>
            
                Game on! SKP is seeking a highly skilled and creatively-driven video game animator 
                to level up our team. As a video game animator, you'll be the ultimate boss of 
                creating top-notch animations for characters, creatures, and environments in our 
                epic games. You'll collaborate closely with our team of game designers, artists, and 
                programmers to craft a world where every move counts and gameplay is always engaging. 
                So, if you're ready to bring your A-game and join us on our quest for gaming greatness, 
                then let's power up and press start!

            </p>

            <p>
                All Game Animators report directly to their team leaders and fall under the Animation Creative Department. 
                SKP is currently hiring for a new internal project. Your team leader is Hope Elsten, she's got over a decade's 
                experience in the gaming industry and is currently in love with Doom and Animal crossing. We'd reccomend you 
                brush up on your gaming trivia prior to "securing the bag" during the group and solo interviews!
            </p>

            <p><strong><em>Graduate and Direct Entry application streams:</em></strong></p>
            <p>
            We are all about giving our team members the opportunity to succeed in the video game industry. 
            That's why we offer two different paths for aspiring video game animators to join our team: 
            through our graduate program or through direct entry.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our graduate program is designed for recent graduates who are passionate about video game 
                animation and want to gain more experience before diving into a full-time role. As a graduate 
                program participant, you'll work alongside our experienced team members and receive mentorship 
                and training to help you level up your skills. You'll also have the opportunity to work on real-world 
                projects and gain valuable industry experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the other hand, direct entry is the perfect option for experienced video game animators 
                who are ready to hit the ground running and dive straight into a full-time role. If you've 
                already got the skills and experience needed to succeed in our fast-paced environment, then 
                direct entry might be the perfect fit for you.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whichever path you choose, we're committed to helping you succeed and reach your full 
                potential in the gaming industry. So if you're ready to level up your game and 
                join the SKP team, then apply now and let's make some magic together!
